    add new page in app\ for rebuilding an Airtable project.
    airtable\csv-json contains all json data exported from Airtable(converted csv's from airtable\csv). Each json file is named after the corresponding Airtable table.
    airtable\js contains automation codes from the same Airtable project. each js file has an explanation of its purpose at the top of the file.
    work to rebuild the Airtable project using the json data and js automation codes.
    infer the relationships between tables based on column names and data patterns.
    infer each field's type (e.g., single line text, number, date, linked record, etc.) based on the data in the json files.
    infer any formulas or computed fields based on the data patterns.
    infer any automation logic based on the js files.
    infer Data Formatting rules based on the data patterns.
    attempt to reconstruct the Airtable project as accurately as possible.
    attempt to recreate the Airtable layout and user interface as closely as possible.
    including top navigation, sidebars, views, filters, sorts, and any other UI elements.
    top navigation should include: Data, Automations, Interfaces, Forms
    below that should be the appControlsContainer with links to different tables (based on json file names)
    use the existing table component to display each table's data.
    ////////////////////

////////////////////
    place all table universal functions in a new file called tableUtils.ts in the utils folder.
    /////////////////////

////////////////////
    add to utils\tableUtils.ts a function that generates an interactive table with the following features:
    make double clicking a row in the table makes that row editable.
    make Expand details button expand the row to show more details optional
    double clicking a column header makes that column name editable.
    each column width is adjustable by dragging the edge of the column header.
    each height is adjustable by dragging the edge of the row.
    the height of all the header rows is adjustable together by dragging the bottom edge of the header row.
    include all basic excel like table functions.
    for example, selecting multiple cells and copying and pasting values.
    selecting multiple rows and deleting them.
    selecting multiple rows and duplicating them.
    clicking and dragging to fill values down a column.
    ctrl+z to undo the last action.
    ctrl+y to redo the last undone action.
    ctrl+f to search within the table.
    plus symbol at the bottom of the table to add a new row.
    plus symbol at the end of the column headers to add a new column.
    right clicking on a column header to open a context menu with options to delete the column, rename the column, change the column type, and other column settings.

    add icons for each of the column types listed above.
    use icons from a public icon library like FontAwesome or Material Icons.
    fix table is missing a lot of functions:
    1. right click selected cells to open context menu with options to cut, copy, paste, delete, insert row above, insert row below, insert column left, insert column right, delete row, delete column.
    2. color controls for cell background color and text color.
    3. click and drag to reorder columns.
    4. click and drag to reorder rows.
    5. finish cell edit by pressing enter key.
    6. cancel cell edit by pressing escape key.
    7. show icon in column header before the column name based on column type.
    8. when changing column type, convert existing data to the new type if possible.
    9. add collapsing sidebar on the left with list of views of the active table.each view should have an icon based on its type. follow this list of view types and their corresponding icons:
       Grid — blue 2×2 table/grid icon (four squares).
       Calendar — orange calendar page icon.
       Gallery — blue 3×3 tiles icon.

        b. cancel cell edit by pressing escape key.
        c. multi-line text editing with line breaks using shift+enter.
        d. text alignment options (left, center, right).
        e. text formatting options (bold, italic, underline).
        f. drag to select text within a cell.

        h. 
    11. add star column functionality.
        default 5 Empty stars for each row.
        clicking on a star fills in that star and all stars to the left of it.
        hovering over a star highlights that star and all stars to the left of it.
        ability to set the maximum number of stars (e.g., 3-star rating, 10-star rating).
    12. make drag to reorder columns and rows show a visual placeholder where the column or row will be dropped.
        make drag to reorder columns and rows visually show the column or row being dragged by the mouse.

    13. disable text selection unless editing cell
    14. on hover of a cell, show a light border around the cell to indicate it is hoverable.
    15. on hover of an edge of a column header or row, make the whole edge more blue and 2.5px to indicate it is draggable for resizing.
    16. all icons should match text height and be vertically centered.
    17. Handle Resizer:
    when resizing a column or row, show a 4px x 25px handle that follows the mouse to indicate the new size. this handle should slide along the edge being resized. now the whole edge lights up, but a handle would be better. a handle is a small rectangle that follows the mouse along the edge being resized. and by follow along the edge, I mean it should only move in one direction (horizontally for column resizing, vertically for row resizing).
    18. when hovering/resizing a column or row, show a vertical or horizontal bar that follows the mouse sliding along the edge to indicate edge is draggable.
    confirm there are no duplicate lines lighting up when hovering or duplicate handles appearing when resizing.
    19. make Expand details button expand as a fullscreen popup modal instead of expanding the row height.
    20. make this list a dropdown for each column header:
        open on hover or click of a down arrow icon next to the column name.
        place icons on the left side of each option.
        options:
        Edit field — pencil icon.
        Duplicate field — two overlapping squares icon.
        Insert left — left arrow icon.
        Insert right — right arrow icon.
        Copy field URL — link/chain icon.
        Edit field description — info “i” in a circle icon.
        Edit field permissions — padlock icon.
        Sort ☐ → ☑ — sort icon (unchecked to checked for checkbox fields).
        Sort ☑ → ☐ — sort icon (checked to unchecked for checkbox fields).
        Filter by this field — funnel/filter icon.
        Group by this field — grouped rows/table stacks icon.
        Show dependencies — sliders/controls icon.
        Hide field — eye with a slash icon.
        Delete field — trash can icon.
    21. add a load more button at the bottom of the table when there are more rows to load.
    22. implement virtual scrolling for performance with large datasets. Only render the rows and columns that are visible in the viewport.
    23. add a confirmation modal when deleting rows or columns to prevent accidental deletions.
    24. table snapshots isbeing covered by the table in airtable rebuild page. adjust z-indexes to ensure the snapshots dropdown appears above the table.
    25. prompt user to set type and name when creating a new column.
    26. the aria-label="Table views" tab should be a dropdown that only appears when the 'Create new...' button is clicked, and disappears when clicking outside of it.
    27. when pasting data into the table, automatically create new rows if the pasted data exceeds the current number of rows.
    28. include all tables in the airtable page. this is the list of all json files that all require a table on the airtable page: 
        airtable\csv-json\Accentra Catalogue-Grid view.json
        airtable\csv-json\Area Tags-Grid view.json
        airtable\csv-json\Component Summary-Grid view.json
        airtable\csv-json\Component Type-Grid view.json
        airtable\csv-json\Components copy-Grid view.json
        airtable\csv-json\Components-Grid view.json
        airtable\csv-json\Customers-quote.json
        airtable\csv-json\Doors Staging-Grid view.json
        airtable\csv-json\Field Mapping-Grid view.json
        airtable\csv-json\File Uploads-Grid view.json
        airtable\csv-json\Group Output-Grid view.json
        airtable\csv-json\Hardware Items-Grid view.json
        airtable\csv-json\Hardware Set Items-Grid view.json
        airtable\csv-json\Hardware Sets-Grid view.json
        airtable\csv-json\Hardware Staging-Grid view.json
        airtable\csv-json\Item Categories-Grid view.json
        airtable\csv-json\Markup Overrides-Grid view.json
        airtable\csv-json\Openings-Grid view.json
        airtable\csv-json\Price Overrides-Grid view.json
        airtable\csv-json\Projects-Grid view.json
        airtable\csv-json\Quote Line Items-Grid view.json
        airtable\csv-json\Staging-Grid view.json
        airtable\csv-json\Submittals-Grid view.json
    29. column dropdown menu is getting cut off at the bottom of the screen. make it open upwards when there is not enough space below the column header. also apply this logic to other dropdowns that may be cut off by the viewport edges.
    30. when editing a cell near the bottom of the viewport, make sure the entire cell is visible by scrolling the table if necessary.
    31. add the ability to drag and drop table tabs to reorder them.
    32. add clicking the header from a column selects that entire column.
    33. add a numbering system at the left of each row, and add clicking the number from a row selects that entire row. on
    34. on hover the row number become a checkbox to select the row.
    35. add select all checkbox in the top left corner of the table to select/deselect all rows.
    36. column header dropdown menu button should float to the right and should be hidden by default and only appear when hovering over the column header. and dropdown menu should only appear when clicking the button, not on hover of the entire column header.
    37.  all dropdowns and filters work in app/page but Grid view, Hide Fields, Filter, Group, Sort, Color and Undo do not work in app/airtable/page yet.
    fix these issues.
    38. when changing a column type to single select or multiple select, preserve existing values by mapping them to new options.
    39. make a universal rule that clicking outside of any open dropdown, modal, cell editor, cell or context menu closes it or deactivates it or saves it as appropriate then closes it or deactivates it. so if the user makes a change in a cell, then clicks outside the cell, it saves the change and closes the cell editor. if the user opens a dropdown menu, then clicks outside the dropdown, it closes the dropdown. if the user opens a modal, then clicks outside the modal, it closes the modal. if the user right clicks to open a context menu, then clicks outside the context menu, it closes the context menu.
    40. for single select and multiple select columns, double clicking a cell opens a dropdown to select options instead of a text input. the list of options should appear in a dropdown below the cell, with a search bar at the top to filter options. the dropdown should appear ontop of other table elements. the dropdown should expand upwards if there is not enough space below the cell. and the dropdown should expand downwards if there is not enough space above the cell. 
    41. the Edit field button in column header dropdown should open another dropdown menu with options to edit field settings instead of opening the field to rename the column. if a dropdown in imgReferences/airtable_dropdown_specs.txt is called a "field configuration", then that dropdown should open when clicking the Edit field button in the column header dropdown menu and the column type matches the dropdown.
    42. an .env.local file was created to store environment variables for neon database connection. make sure to add .env.local to .gitignore to prevent it from being committed to version control.
    43. create a new neon table for each Airtable table in the Airtable project being rebuilt. make sure to set up the correct columns and data based on the json files.
    44. replace json files with neon data for each Airtable table json file to the corresponding neon table. so all json data is now stored in neon database instead of local json files.
    45. the user should be able to view and edit data in each neon table through the interactive table component. this includes creating, updating, and deleting columns, fields and rows
    46. implement real-time synchronization between the table component and the neon database
    . use the neon database connection to fetch and save data. you may need to modify the table component to work with neon data instead of json data. you may also need to create new api routes to handle database operations.try to make a new utils file if necessary to handle any database interactions.
